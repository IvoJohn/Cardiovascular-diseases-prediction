# Cardio

In this project I wanted to train models to predict risk of cardiovascular diseases. To do it I used dataset of 70 thousand patients
(once again obtained from Kaggle) with features possible to obtain during simple physical examination. The results
(similar to results of others) seem to be too low to use these predictions in a real life situations (probably we would need more features or bigger
database) but could be useful for putting patients under further screening during routine visits at GP.
