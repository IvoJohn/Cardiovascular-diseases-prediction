# Cardio

In this project I predicted risk of cardiovascular diseases. To do this I used a dataset of 70 thousand patients obtained from Kaggle with features possible to measure during simple physical examination. The results seem to be too low to use these predictions in a real life situations. This was a general problem with this dataset, observed by others as well. Probably more features or their different selection could be beneficial.
Now the model might be useful only for eventua putting patients under further screening after their routine visit at GP.
